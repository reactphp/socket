/**
 * The `SecureServer` class implements the `ServerInterface` and is responsible
 * for providing a secure TLS (formerly known as SSL) server.
 *
 * It does so by wrapping a `TcpServer` instance which waits for plaintext
 * TCP/IP connections and then performs a TLS handshake for each connection.
 *
 * ```php
 * $server = new TcpServer(8000, $loop);
 * $server = new SecureServer($server, $loop, array(
 *     // tls context options here…
 * ));
 * ```
 *
 * Whenever a client completes the TLS handshake, it will emit a `connection` event
 * with a connection instance implementing [`ConnectionInterface`](#connectioninterface):
 *
 * ```php
 * $server->on('connection', function (ConnectionInterface $connection) {
 *     echo 'Secure connection from' . $connection->getRemoteAddress() . PHP_EOL;
 *
 *     $connection->write('hello there!' . PHP_EOL);
 *     …
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Whenever a client fails to perform a successful TLS handshake, it will emit an
 * `error` event and then close the underlying TCP/IP connection:
 *
 * ```php
 * $server->on('error', function (Exception $e) {
 *     echo 'Error' . $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * See also the `ServerInterface` for more details.
 *
 * Note that the `SecureServer` class is a concrete implementation for TLS sockets.
 * If you want to typehint in your higher-level protocol implementation, you SHOULD
 * use the generic `ServerInterface` instead.
 *

     * Creates a secure TLS server and starts waiting for incoming connections
     *
     * It does so by wrapping a `TcpServer` instance which waits for plaintext
     * TCP/IP connections and then performs a TLS handshake for each connection.
     * It thus requires valid [TLS context options],
     * which in its most basic form may look something like this if you're using a
     * PEM encoded certificate file:
     *
     * ```php
     * $server = new TcpServer(8000, $loop);
     * $server = new SecureServer($server, $loop, array(
     *     'local_cert' => 'server.pem'
     * ));
     * ```
     *
     * Note that the certificate file will not be loaded on instantiation but when an
     * incoming connection initializes its TLS context.
     * This implies that any invalid certificate file paths or contents will only cause
     * an `error` event at a later time.
     *
     * If your private key is encrypted with a passphrase, you have to specify it
     * like this:
     *
     * ```php
     * $server = new TcpServer(8000, $loop);
     * $server = new SecureServer($server, $loop, array(
     *     'local_cert' => 'server.pem',
     *     'passphrase' => 'secret'
     * ));
     * ```
     *
     * Note that available [TLS context options],
     * their defaults and effects of changing these may vary depending on your system
     * and/or PHP version.
     * Passing unknown context options has no effect.
     *
     * Advanced usage: Despite allowing any `ServerInterface` as first parameter,
     * you SHOULD pass a `TcpServer` instance as first parameter, unless you
     * know what you're doing.
     * Internally, the `SecureServer` has to set the required TLS context options on
     * the underlying stream resources.
     * These resources are not exposed through any of the interfaces defined in this
     * package, but only through the internal `Connection` class.
     * The `TcpServer` class is guaranteed to emit connections that implement
     * the `ConnectionInterface` and uses the internal `Connection` class in order to
     * expose these underlying resources.
     * If you use a custom `ServerInterface` and its `connection` event does not
     * meet this requirement, the `SecureServer` will emit an `error` event and
     * then close the underlying connection.
